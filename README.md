# Python for DICOM: From Zero to Hero

## Introduction

Welcome to "Python for DICOM: From Zero to Hero," a comprehensive guide designed for radiologists, medical physicists, and anyone interested in medical imaging. This project aims to introduce Python programming in the context of handling DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files, providing you with the tools to create powerful applications for radiology.

## Why Python for DICOM?

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language that offers simplicity alongside powerful libraries and frameworks, making it ideal for processing and analyzing medical images. With its ease of learning and open-source nature, Python enables rapid development and experimentation, making it a perfect choice for innovative projects in medical imaging.

## Lecture Overview

This lecture series covers everything from basic Python programming concepts to advanced applications in handling DICOM files. Here's what you can expect:

- **Introduction to Python**: Learn why Python is a key language for AI and machine learning projects, and why it's particularly suited for radiology applications.
- **Getting Started**: We guide you through setting up your Python environment, whether you're coding directly in the browser with Google Colab, using Jupyter Notebooks through Anaconda, or running Python on your local machine.
- **Python Basics**: Dive into the core concepts of Python programming, including variables, data types, conditional clauses, loops, and more. These fundamentals lay the groundwork for working with DICOM files.
- **Working with DICOM Files**: Discover how to leverage Python for medical imaging tasks. Learn to open, read, and manipulate DICOM files, use libraries like PyDicom and Matplotlib for image processing, and understand the DICOM standard's complexities.
- **Advanced Topics**: Explore advanced applications such as creating your DICOM viewer, understanding the DICOM file structure, anonymizing DICOM data, and more. We'll also touch on the importance of data anonymization and provide practical tips for pseudonymizing and de-identifying medical data.
- **Hands-On Projects**: Apply what you've learned through engaging with real-world projects. You'll practice everything from displaying DICOM images to advanced manipulation of pixel data. Experience firsthand how to code a DICOM viewer equipped with MPR reconstruction, apply windowing techniques, and export images for further use.
- **Integration with LLM-Vision**: Conclude your project by exporting an image from your DICOM web viewer to the GPT-Vision Model. This integration allows you to leverage the power of Large Language Models in interpreting potential diseases from your patient's images, showcasing the intersection of medical imaging and AI in modern diagnostics.

## Why a Radiologist should learn Python?

This course is designed to take you from a beginner to a proficient user, capable of handling complex DICOM datasets and developing your applications. Whether you're looking to improve your workflow, contribute to research, or simply explore the intersection of programming and radiology, this lecture offers the knowledge and skills you need.
